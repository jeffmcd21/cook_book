- 1/2 cup (8g) chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems
- 3 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 2-inch cubes
- 1 tablespoon (8g) kosher salt, plus more to taste; for table salt, use half of the volume or an equal amount by weight
- 1 medium orange
- 6 cloves garlic, halved, divided
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 cinnamon stick, broken into three or four pieces

## <u>Directions:</u>

#### Step 1:
- Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 275°F (135°C). Cut one onion into fine dice and combine with cilantro. Refrigerate until needed.

#### Step 2:
- Split remaining onion into quarters. Set aside. Season pork with 1 tablespoon salt and place in a 9- by 13-inch glass baking dish. The pork should fill the dish with no extra space.

#### Step 3:
- Split orange into quarters and squeeze juice over pork. Nestle squeezed orange pieces into dish.

#### Step 4:
- Add 2 onion quarters, 4 cloves garlic, bay leaves, and cinnamon stick to dish. Nestle everything into an even layer.

#### Step 5:
- Pour vegetable oil over surface. Cover dish tightly with aluminum foil and place in oven. Cook until pork is fork tender, about 3 1/2 hours.

#### Step 6:
- Set large fine-mesh strainer over a 1-quart liquid measuring cup or bowl. Using tongs, remove and discard orange peel, onion, garlic, cinnamon stick, and bay leaves.

#### Step 7:
- Transfer pork, rendered fat, and cooking liquid to strainer. Let drain for 10 minutes.

#### Step 8:
- Transfer pork back to baking dish. You should end up with about 1/2 cup cooking liquid and 1/2 cup fat.

#### Step 9:
- Using a flat spoon or fat separator, skim fat from surface and add back to pork.

#### Step 10:
- Shred pork into large chunks with fingers or two forks. Season to taste with salt. Refrigerate until ready to serve.

#### Step 11:
- Transfer remaining cooking liquid to medium saucepan.

#### Step 12:
- Add tomatillos, remaining 2 onion quarters, remaining 2 garlic cloves, and jalapeños to saucepan with strained pork liquid.

#### Step 13:
- Add water until it is about 1 inch below the top of the vegetables.

#### Step 14:
- Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a simmer, and cook until all vegetables are completely tender, about 10 minutes.

#### Step 15:
- Blend salsa with immersion blender or in a countertop blender until smooth.

#### Step 16:
- Season to taste with salt. Allow to cool and refrigerate until ready to use.

#### Step 17:
- To serve: Preheat broiler to high with oven rack 4 inches below heating element.

#### Step 18:
- Broil pork until brown and crisp on surface, about 6 minutes.

#### Step 19:
- Remove pork, stir with a spoon to expose new bits to heat, and broil again until crisp, 6 more minutes.

#### Step 20:
- Tent with foil to keep warm.

#### Step 21:
- Meanwhile, heat tortillas. Preheat an 8-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until hot.

#### Step 22:
- Working one tortilla at a time, dip tortilla in bowl filled with water.

#### Step 23:
- Transfer to hot skillet and cook until water evaporates from first side and tortilla is browned in spots, about 30 seconds.

#### Step 24:
- Flip and cook until dry, about 15 seconds longer.

#### Step 25:
- Transfer tortilla to a tortilla warmer, or wrap in a clean dish towel.

#### Step 26:
- Repeat with remaining tortillas.

#### Step 27:
- To eat, stack two tortillas on top of each other.

#### Step 28:
- Add two to three tablespoons carnitas mixture to center.

#### Step 29:
- Top with salsa verde, chopped onions and cilantro, queso fresco, and lime.
