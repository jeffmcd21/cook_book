##### Servings: 8

## <u>Ingredients:</u>

### Meatballs:
- 1/3 cup sweet onion, grated
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 large egg
- 1/3 lb ground beef 
- 1/3 lb ground pork
- 1/3 lb ground veal
- 1/2 cup grated parmigiana reggiano
- 1/3 cup seasoned Itailian bread crumbs
- 1/4 cup flat leaf parsley, chopped 
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/3 cup milk
- Black pepper


### Soup:
- 2 tbsp EVOO
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1 medium yellow onion, diced
- 2 large carrots, diced
- 2 stalks celery, diced
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 6 cups chicken broth
- 2 cups beef broth
- 2 cups water
- 2 bay leaf
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp pepper
- Parmigiana rind
- 1 lb dittalini pasta
- 3 cups packed curly endive, loosly chopped
- Parmigiana reggiano


## <u>Directions:</u>

#### Step 1:
- In a small skillet over medium-low heat add EVOO to cover the bottom then add the onion. Cook until translucent and lightly browned. Then add the garlic cook for a 2 minutes then remove from heat and let cool.

#### Step 2:
- Beat the egg in a small bowl and set aside. Then in a medium size mixing bowl add the beef, pork, veal, parmigiana, bread crumbs, parsley, salt, milk, pepper. Mix a little just to get started then add the onion/garlic and the egg, mix well with hands.

#### Step 3:
- Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, form mixture into meatballs (size of your preference), I prefer them on the small size for this dish. Once complete but the baking sheet in the refridgerator for at least an hour upto over night.

#### Step 4:
- Heat a large stockpot over medium heat add a small amount of EVOO then fry the meatballs on all sides to get a dark brown color. (Best to fry the meatballs cold to prevent them from over cooking the in fry stage). Fry in batches and return them to the baking sheet as they are done.

#### Step 5:
- In the same stockpot over medium-low heat add the onions, carrots and celery cooking until soft. Then add the wine and continue to cook for another minute followed by the chicken stock, beef stock, water, bay leafs, salt, pepper and parmsean rind. Allow this to simmer on low heat for 30 minutes to an hour.

#### Step 6:
- Once the soup is getting close to the point of completion in a separate pot boil salted water and cook pasta according to instructions. At the time you drop the pasta add the meatballs into the soup and just before the pasta is done add the endive to the soup. Drain the pasta and set aside.

#### Step 7:
- Add some of the pasta to a bowl and ladle soup over the top, garnish with grated cheese and EVOO.
